# Feedback Directory

This directory accumulates feedback from projects that use the bootstrapper. It is **append-only** -- reports and learnings are never deleted or modified after creation.

## How to Add Feedback

### After Auditing a Project

The `/audit-project` command automatically saves a report to `project-reports/`. Reports are named `{project-name}-{date}.md`.

### Recording a Meta-Learning

When you notice a pattern across multiple projects or discover something about the bootstrapper itself, append to `meta-learnings.md` following the format in that file.

## Directory Contents

- `project-reports/` - One report per audited project (auto-generated by `/audit-project`)
- `meta-learnings.md` - Cross-project patterns and bootstrapper insights (append-only)

## How Feedback Is Used

The `/self-improve` command reads all project reports and meta-learnings to identify:
- Templates that consistently need modification after initialization
- Rubric criteria that don't differentiate well
- Prompts that lead to confusion or repeated questions
- Patterns that should be promoted to templates

See `../EVOLUTION.md` for the full change governance process.
