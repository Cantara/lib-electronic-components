domain_skills:
  count: "7+"
  description: >
    Seven or more domain-specific skills organized by subsystem.
    For very large projects, skills may be grouped in subdirectories.
  organization: >
    When skill count exceeds 15, organize into subdirectories:
    .claude/skills/api/
    .claude/skills/data/
    .claude/skills/deployment/
    etc.
  examples:
    - "api.md - REST API patterns"
    - "database.md - Schema and query patterns"
    - "testing.md - Test conventions"
    - "deployment.md - CI/CD pipeline"
    - "security.md - Auth, secrets, permissions"
    - "monitoring.md - Logging, metrics, alerts"
    - "performance.md - Optimization patterns"

custom_commands:
  description: >
    Project-specific slash commands in .claude/commands/
    that automate common workflows.
  examples:
    - "deploy.md - Deploy to staging/production"
    - "review-pr.md - Comprehensive PR review checklist"
    - "debug.md - Common debugging workflows"

constraints:
  claude_md_max_lines: 300

maturity_indicators:
  - "Skills contain non-template content from real development sessions"
  - "HISTORY.md has 10+ entries spanning multiple months"
  - "FIXED_BUGS.md has real bug entries with analysis"
  - "Custom commands exist and are referenced in CLAUDE.md"
  - "Task delegation is actively used (evidence in commit history)"
