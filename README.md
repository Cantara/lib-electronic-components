# lib-electronic-components

A start of a library to make it a bit more meaningful to work digitally with electronic components.

Features like
* Validations
* Standardize
* Normalize
* Find alternatives 
* Find similar components
* Categorization 
* Type detection
* Manufacturers
* Similarity Calculators

As the market changes daily, this will never be 100% - but we believe that it 
should bring value to systems dealing with electronic components.
